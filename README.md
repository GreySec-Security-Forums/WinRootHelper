# WinRootHelper
PowerShell script to help with privilege escalation on a compromised Windows box.

This script is partially based on it's Linux counterpart [RootHelper](https://github.com/NullArray/RootHelper). 

## Alpha Release

This tool is in early stages of development as such this is an Alpha release. Starting the script will take you to a menu from which you can select three options that download and extract other tools that may be useful in privilege escalation on a compromised Windows machine.

### Pull requests Welcome!

By releasing this script in Alpha, under the banner of the [GreySec Security Forums](https://wwww.greysec.net) the hope is that the project will be expanded upon in an Open Source collaborative manner. Thus, all additions and updates are welcome but subject to review by Repo and Organization owners and collaborators.

For some resources on Windows privilege escalation techniques you can check out a small list i compiled to get started. Find it by clicking the `resources.md` dile or simply click [here](https://github.com/GreySec-Security-Forums/WinRoothelper/blob/master/resources.md) 

If you have any questions please feel free to open a ticket. Should the need arise we will set up a section on contribution guidelines. 

Thank you.
