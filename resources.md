### Resources

Here are some resources that might be interesting to dig through with regards to privilege escalation tools
and techniques on Windows.

I reccomend starting at [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) by [RedCanaryCo](https://github.com/redcanaryco).

I suggest we include [this](https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng) tool in an upcoming update as well.


Below are a few other scripts, repos and sites i've come across that may be of interest.
